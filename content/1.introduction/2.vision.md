# Our Vision (in draft)

We envision a future where not-for-profit, decentralized social media platforms become the favored choice over today's profit-driven services. Our collective will play a pivotal role in this transition by bolstering trust in decentralized platforms and enhancing the overall user experience. We aim to streamline the journey for users considering the move to decentralized servers, while simultaneously equipping server owners with advanced tools and efficient processes to simplify and broaden hosting capabilities. Our ultimate goal is to foster a digital ecosystem where decentralization is the standard, providing individuals with a straightforward, empowering, and unbiased environment that prioritizes the user over profits and politics.
