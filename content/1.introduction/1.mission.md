# Our Mission (in draft)

Our mission is to empower and expedite the global shift from centralized, profit-driven social media services to decentralized, non-profit platforms. We strive to enhance the experiences of users and administrators, fostering a digital ecosystem that prioritizes transparency, fairness, and community over profit.
